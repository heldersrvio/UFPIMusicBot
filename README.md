# UFPIMusicBot
An assignment from my Object Oriented Programming class. Our goal was to develop a Telegram bot that showcased the knowledge we acquired throughout the semester in regards to Object Oriented Programming concepts and handling databases and SQL. 

It was written in Java and I chose Facebook's wit.ai to help me with Natural Language Processing.
